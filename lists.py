""" this program demonstrates how lists work, including how to print, change and append items """

# lists always have square brackets. items are separated by commas
fruit = ["apples", "bananas", "pineapple", "oranges"]

# to print an item from a list, we use the name of the list and its index (which starts at 0)
print(fruit[3])
